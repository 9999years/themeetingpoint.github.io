I have always known that I was meant to impact peoples’ lives, touch their souls, and empower them to be the best they can be.

In the corporate world where I worked in restaurant management and financial industry for over fifteen years combined, I have mentored numerous people.  I continued to make a difference in the not for profit sector as a volunteer and a community leader. After so many years of empowering others, Imani, the Swahili word for faith, inspired and empowered me. With that said I stepped out on faith and enrolled in massage therapy school at Cortiva Institute. I have been a licensed massage therapist since 2011. My courage to begin a new career path is what inspired me to name my business Imani.

I am trained in a variety of modalities and continue to train and develop my techniques and specialties.  I am proud to offer the strength behind Sport Massage Therapy, the compassionate touch for the frail and elderly, the gentle strokes for mom’s to be, the caring touch for infants, and the relaxing touch for the over worked.

I will work with you to develop a maintenance schedule to facilitate a healthy living style. Call 617.821.2875 or visit [imanimassage.com](https://www.imanimassage.com/) to schedule an appointment.
