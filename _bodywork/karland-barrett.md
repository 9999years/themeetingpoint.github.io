At 3R Massages LLC, we believe that we are all on a journey through Life, and on this journey, the vehicle you use is your body. Like all vehicles, the body requires regular maintenance and care. Regular massage and preventative maintenance (preventative health care) are one way in which we do our part to give ourselves a vehicle that will make our journey through life as long and healthy as possible.  

3R Massage was established by Licensed Traveling Massage Therapist Karland Barrett. (Lic # 13675, Massachusetts.) A Veteran of the United States Marine Corps, Karland has always and continues to have a passion for service which eventually lead him to pursue a career in the Massage and Bodywork field. Karland developed 3R Massages as a way to meet people where they are and bring these self-care methods to your homes, corporate offices, or other designated spaces.
