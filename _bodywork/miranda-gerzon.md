I received my master's from The New England School of Acupuncture (now MCPHS University) here in Boston, specializing in Chinese and Japanese Acupuncture as well as Chinese Herbal Medicine.  I'm excited to offer private acupuncture sessions at The Meeting Point. In my treatments I utilize different techniques and styles depending on the individual's symptoms and constitution, including cupping (think Michael Phelps at the Olympics), gwa sha, and moxibustion. For those unfamiliar with acupuncture, it is part of an ancient healing modality that has been used for more than 2,500 years. What I appreciate most about the medicine is that it deeply understands the intricacies and interconnectedness between mind, body and spirit/shen. On a physiological level, acupuncture reduces inflammation, increases blood flow, regulates the nervous system, lessens pain sensitivity and improves emotional well-being through its effect on endorphins, serotonin and dopamine. For this reason, it can be a helpful for those struggling with stress, anxiety, depression or chronic pain. Other commonly treated complaints that I see include: fatigue, digestive issues, women's health issues, insomnia, allergies, trauma/PTSD, addiction, immune boosting/common colds and many more. 

I currently offer a sliding scale and am unable to accept insurance plans at this time.
