teaser: I’m a firm believer that a person will not feel safe exploring difficult areas in therapy if they don’t feel comfortable with and understand the human sitting across from them.
availability: At this time, my practice is unfortunately full. But please feel free to get in touch if you are interested in an update.

Because my background is primarily in non­traditional clinical settings, I tend to approach my work non­traditionally. My work with each client is integrative and dynamic. My “home base” is in contemporary feminist psychodynamic therapy, but I utilize techniques from CBT, DBT, mindfulness, interpersonal neurobiology and sensorimotor psychotherapy to tailor my approach to a client’s presenting needs.

I’m a firm believer that a person will not feel safe exploring difficult areas in therapy if they don’t feel comfortable with and understand the human sitting across from them. Therefore, I want you to see my personality and sense of humor as we collaborate, so that we can build a strong working relationship built on trust and mutual understanding. I am an active therapist! I don’t like sitting back and asking “how does that make you feel?” I like to offer interpretations, suggestions and questions with your input to assist us both in reaching a deeper understanding. Most of all, I am open to your feedback about whether things are working for you.

I obtained my Masters in Clinical Social Work from the University of Chicago, and hold a previous Masters in Anthropology and Women’s & Gender Studies from Brandeis University. My practice experience has mainly been in community­-based mental health, with a special focus on the health and human rights of historically marginalized communities.

My specialty areas include:

* LGBTQI experiences, with a special focus on providing affirming counseling to trans and gender nonconforming individuals
* Individuals living with HIV/AIDS and other chronic medical conditions
* Depression and anxiety
* Grief and loss
* Trauma
* Intimate partner violence
* Recovery from substance use and other addictions (harm reduction model of treatment)
* Exploring relational dynamics and concerns (e.g. family, friendships, intimate partners, dating, divorce or separation)
* Life/identity transitions (e.g. aging, retirement, becoming a parent, spiritual questions).
