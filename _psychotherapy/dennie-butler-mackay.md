Dennie is a clinical social worker with nearly 30 years of clinical experience that formally began with her training at the Boston University School of Social Work (BUSSW); she was recently awarded the 2018 Outstanding Career in Social Work Award by the BUSSW Alumni Association. While Dennie draws primarily on her certification as a sensorimotor psychotherapist, her training, skillset, and intuition is grounded in a variety of other traditional and nontraditional healing approaches. The range includes training in the Attachment-Regulation-Competency (ARC)Framework, EMDR, Mindfulness, Meditation, Reiki, Plant Medicine and Dream Work to name a few.

Over the years, Dennie has cultivated an expertise in the treatment of trauma, PTSD, attachment issues, depression, anxiety, and panic.  She enjoys working with adolescents, families, and adults.  In her work Dennie fosters a sense of hope, possibility, and vision, by nurturing a sense of loving compassion for one’s self.

In addition to her emerging private practice at The Meeting Point, Dennie continues to hold her role as a senior clinical social worker at Southern Jamaica Plain Health Center where she is also the co-director of racial justice and equity initiatives, and the clinical consultant to community programs. Dennie’s work and heart felt energy has expanded to state and national stages where she is viewed as a healer, an activist, an educator, and a presenter.  Dennie is equally passionate about working with individuals and looks forward to her practice taking root at The Meeting Point.

First sessions are consultations where you and Dennie can assess whether there is a match upon which to begin a therapeutic relationship.  How often you meet after that, will be discussed based on your needs.

Email or call Dennie if you would like to set up a consultation. Email responses are sometimes quicker due to time constraints.
