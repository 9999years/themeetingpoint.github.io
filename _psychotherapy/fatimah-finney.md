Welcome and thank you for stopping by! I am trained as a Level 1 Internal Family Systems therapist, and I fundamentally believe that healing begins with a healthy attachment to your inner self. Such an attachment requires focus on the relationship between mind, body and spirit. You are the expert and have important knowledge about what you need to achieve health and well-being. Together, we will explore this knowledge and channel it in service of the goals you want to achieve. I bring an eclectic skill set that pulls from Internal Family Systems (IFS), Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT), Mindfulness, and Expressive Arts modalities, and tailor them to the needs and strengths of my clients.

Iâ€™ve served clients working through anxiety, depression, substance use, grief and loss, intergenerational trauma, problems with focus and attention, decision-making, and survivors of trauma, including physical, sexual and emotional abuse.

I am currently offering appointments on Tuesdays and Saturdays and can accept private pay/sliding scale clients and clients with Blue Cross Blue Shield insurance. Please contact me directly for updates on my availability regarding insurance.
