For more than 15 years, I have provided therapy to individuals, couples and groups, as well as offering training, consultation and clinical supervision to community organizations.  My work centers around bridging transitions, fostering personal growth and developing compassionate responses and strategies to address life’s challenges. In addition to providing support and encouragement, I will challenge you to think critically about the choices you are making and to work toward overcoming the obstacles that may be keeping you from achieving your goals.

Whether you’re trying to learn something new, working on making a transition, or building your support network, you have a lot of choice about how and with whom you work on achieving your goals. There are therapists and other service providers to appeal to everyone’s personal style. Taking the time to find a professional who is not only credentialed, but who has an approach or philosophy that resonates with you is an important first step.

**My approach to everything that I do is to be as real as I can be.** Whether I’m working with an individual in a therapy session, presenting to a large audience or collaborating on a community project, I’ve never been someone who is good at faking it. What you see is what you get. I hold myself to the same standards to which I hold my clients—authenticity and honesty are essential. I provide my clients with an accurate reflection of what I see and a professional assessment of how they might do things differently. I will challenge you to think critically about the choices you make and the impact those choices are having on your life.

**I rely heavily on resources that foster creativity and humor.** I don’t rely on gimmicks or hidden agendas—if I’ve got information or tools that will help you, I will share them with you and encourage you to make them your own.

**As a therapist, I work hard to be flexible and responsive to the needs of my clients.** There may be times when you feel you need more encouragement and support and less constructive feedback. Other times you may find that confronting an issue head-on feels more productive. I will encourage both of us to be patient with the process and to pay close attention to progress so that we can make adjustments throughout our work together.

**My areas of expertise include:** mindfulness and meditation; strategies for coping with depression and anxiety; issues around sexuality, sexual functioning and relationships; sexual and gender identity; social skills; trauma; grief; substance use; attention training and living with uncertainty and change.
