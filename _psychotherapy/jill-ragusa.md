For the past 11 years as a clinical social worker, I have been working with adults across a variety of settings. I find connection to be extremely important in my work and draw largely on a relational model with my clients. My approach is holistic and I pay particular attention to the role societal and cultural norms and expectations play peopleâ€™s lives. I enjoy working with people in the LGBTQ community, working with women around pregnancy and post-partum issues, parenting, and infertility related struggles, life transitions, anxiety-related difficulties, and through relationship challenges. I employ patience and humor and partner with my clients to identify goals and help them reach them.
