I believe that the answers to people’s problems lie within, and that I serve as a guide to facilitate the emerging of solutions. My approach is collaborative, strengths-based, and holistic, that is, I see you as a whole person, and believe in the interconnectedness of body, mind and spirit. I welcome those who are new to therapy and perhaps a bit skeptical or uncomfortable, in addition to those who may be quite familiar with the process. My intention is to be as present with you as I can be, and to create a safe, supportive atmosphere where acceptance and compassion play a role in the growth and healing process.

I have experience with individuals, couples, and adolescents of diverse backgrounds. I specialize in the areas of trauma/abuse, domestic violence, stress management, body image issues, substance abuse, relationship issues, as well as those who are simply feeling “stuck” and want a little guidance to create change in their lives.

My training as a Licensed Mental Health Counselor was based in traditional talk therapy, however, I may also incorporate body-based therapies such as yoga, mindfulness techniques, Focusing, EMDR, and EFT, depending on a client’s needs and interests. I am also certified as a Kripalu yoga teacher. Together we can decide what approaches are the best fit. For more information, please visit [www.karenenegess.com](http://www.karenenegess.com./).
