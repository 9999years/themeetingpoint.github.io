Wren’s approach is gentle, respectful and integrative. She collaborates with you to identify where you feel you need help and to determine how to best move through what blocks your self-actualization. Wren believes in the empowerment of therapy to help you thrive. She is engaged in and supportive of the LGBTQ community.
She is totally thrilled to provide individual and group therapy at The Meeting Point!

Wren’s training is based in the Psychodynamic approach which she learned at Smith School for Social Work in the nineties. Other areas of interest and experience include counseling individuals and families at end-of-life; facilitating groups for women (including HIVAIDS education and prevention, survivors of intimate partner violence and self-esteem and grief and loss). She also incorporates mindfulness, guided imagery and relaxation exercises to help manage stress and improve emotion-regulation.

Wren is a certified practitioner in Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) therapy. EMDR integrates many different treatment approaches and is proven as a means of treating trauma and PTSD.

She is also trained in Complicated Grief Treatment (CGT) at Columbia School for Social Work. CGT is an evidenced based therapy which integrates techniques derived from interpersonal therapy, motivational interviewing, positive psychology and cognitive-behavioral therapy.

Wren recognizes that finding the right therapist can be challenging and invites a call or initial visit to see if she is a good fit.
