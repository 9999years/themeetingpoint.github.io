For the past 7 years as a clinical social worker I have been working with adults, adolescents and families in a variety of settings. I received my masterâ€™s in clinical social work from Boston College School of Social Work. I have specialized training in trauma-focused therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy and internal family systems therapy. In addition to my practice at The Meeting Point, I provide psychotherapy at Cambridge Health Alliance.
