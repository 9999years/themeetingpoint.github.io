I have been working for over 20 years to be there for clients. To meet them where they are at in thier journey and recovery. My focus is on your needs, goals, and best interest. I tailor my practice to help clients realize how to maintain those goals. I am an experienced clinician that works with clients struggling with substance abuse, domestic violence, GBLT, and self-esteem issues. I enjoy working with people and feel privileged to be able to experience their journey of self discovery with them. I also have an office at 17 Henshaw street in Brighton.

My areas of interest include: Substance abuse, domestic violence, anxiety issues, self-esteem issues, anger management, GBLT, dual diagnosis. 

I have worked in the past with clients struggling with opiate addiction, and I am available for substance abuse evaluations
