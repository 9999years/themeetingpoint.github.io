Margot brings a warm and interactive style to her psychotherapeutic practice, which can best be described as “eclectic,” as she believes that not one type of therapy is right for everyone. Pulling from psychodynamic (insight-oriented) psychotherapy, cognitive-behavioral techniques, mindfulness/meditation, and somatics (the integration of body/mind/spirit), Margot will tailor her practice to people’s individual needs depending on the particular issues they would like to address in therapy.
