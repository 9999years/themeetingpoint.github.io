In summing up what helped her recognize her own power to effect change in her life, a former client of Robin’s offered this sentiment:

“The grass isn’t greener on the other side; it is greener where you water it.”

With more than 14 years practicing in a variety of environments including school, hospital, and community settings; and in private practice in Massachusetts and Rhode Island, for Robin Haas, LISCSW this has been a guiding principle in their work. Robin (they/them) has provided individual and family counseling, as well as supervision to MSW students and LCSWs. In their work with children, adolescents, and adults, they have supported and guided their clients through the transformative process to help them remove the barriers between themselves and their goals.

Robin Haas, LICSW received a masters degree in social work from Simmons School of Social Work. As a strong proponent in the power of dialogue as a venue toward change, Robin focuses on communication and relationships as vehicles within which their clients may effectively develop tools they need to transform their own lives – and the lives of others. Their dedication and compassion are fueled by the belief that every person has the capacity and the right to recognize true success and happiness.  They utilize a multitude of theories in an effort to meet their clients’ needs including strength-based, dynamic, relational, cognitive, developmental, narrative, constructive, and both short- and long-term treatment.

Robin has done extensive work with those struggling with eating disorders, depression, anxiety, trauma, grief and loss, adoption, separation and divorce, child custody, learning disabilities, sensory motor issues, coming out, questioning identity, and life adjustment issues.

In addition to their volunteer work as a mentor for YouthPride Rhode Island, Rhode Island’s drop in center for LGBT youth and teens, Robin facilitated a global recovery group for those with eating disorders. They are credentialed with most major insurance companies.

For people hoping to free themselves from feeling “stuck” due to self doubt, emotional pain, anger or worry, Robin is a great choice.  Begin now by taking action on your own behalf.
