The Meeting Point is a collective of independent body workers and mental health practitioners who believe support and acceptance of complicated bodies is a social justice issue. As such, we are committed to meeting the needs of underserved populations, particularly GLBTQ identified individuals, people who have experienced trauma, and those with physical and/or emotional disabilities.

As a holistic mind/body collective, we hope to support individuals with complicated bodies and minds in their journey through this complicated and beautiful world. We do this both by providing a home to like-minded practitioners and serving as a resource and site for community events, advocacy, and awareness.

### People Surviving Trauma
Being a survivor is complicated, confusing and painful. The paths to healing can be as diverse and exceptional as survivors themselves.

It takes courage to seek out connection and knowledge. It takes courage to explore the life you are creating with the wisdom of your own survival.

The Meeting Point feeds that courage. We:

SUPPORT: Forming a connection with others who understand your experience is healing.

INFORM: Understanding what is happening to you and what you need is essential in working toward healing.

EXPLORE: Knowing yourself can make it easier to understand your story, to know your strengths and needs, to express your hopes and soothe your pain. Knowing yourself can help you to find compassion for yourself and connection with others.

EMPOWER: You cannot change what has happened, but you can change what it will mean in your life.

### Disability
Disability can impact every aspect of living from the personal to the political.

Disability reverberates through us all. It confronts our ideas about inclusion and exclusion, powerful and powerless, community and autonomy.

Disability can trigger our most primitive fears. Disability can fuel our deepest anger. Disability can inspire our greatest passions. Living with a disability in an ableist culture means countering closely-held assumptions of what it is to be strong, attractive, free, sexual or human.

As people with disabilities, our relationship to these themes changes across time. Our sense of identity, our relationships and our connections to our communities are shaped as our sense of meaning around disability shifts and evolves.

As activists and advocates for access and equality, there are often few places to go to replenish our enthusiasm.

We may not be seeking help or resources due to disability concerns, but we are absolutely entitled to services that are not founded in ableist assumptions. We are entitled to services that are responsive to every aspect of who we are in the world.

The Meeting Point offers services informed by disability and alert to the distinct needs and strengths of every person. We also offer trainings and workshops to perpetuate insight into ableism and the tools to counter it. We can offer a deeper and more complex understanding of the impact of disability on all of our lives.

### Lesbian, Gay, Transgender, and Queer-Identified Folk

We are a large and diverse community with complex needs and often unseen or undervalued resources.

Many of us do not seek or need services simply because we are lesbian, gay, transgender, or queer, but we all need and deserve services that recognize and respond to us for all of who we are. The Meeting Point offers services in a context that is knowledgeable and safe

By virtue of our survival in a heterosexist culture, we are an extraordinary people. We have endured models of psychological health that diagnose us. We have abided by traditions that reject us, and we have embraced norms that render us silent and invisible.

In the face of these constraints, our connections to each other teach us about ourselves. Our connections shape the way that we move through the world. It is in our connections that we access the joy and truth of our own being.

The Meeting Point offers services that are informed by lesbian, gay and transgender ways of living. In workshops, individual, and couples therapy, and groups we strive to cultivate the very strengths and uniquenesses that have sustained us.

Our services are based on the convictions that:

* All people are entitled to self definition and self expression.
* All people are entitled to meaningful participation in the community.
* All people are entitled to the expression and validation of our significant relationships.
* And all people are entitled to services that are informed and responsive to all of who we are.
