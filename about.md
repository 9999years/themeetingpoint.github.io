The Meeting Point is a collective of independent body workers and mental health practitioners who believe support and acceptance of complicated bodies is a social justice issue. As such, we are committed to meeting the needs of underserved populations, particularly GLBTQ identified individuals, people who have experienced trauma, and those with physical and/or emotional disabilities.

As a holistic mind/body collective, we hope to support individuals with complicated bodies and minds in their journey through this complicated and beautiful world. We do this both by providing a home to like-minded practitioners and serving as a resource and site for community events, advocacy, and awareness.

At The Meeting Point:
* We know that there are many ways to heal and grow.
* We know that it can be difficult to access the resources you need to cultivate your own strength and well being.
* We provide multi-dimensional resources that are responsive to your needs.
* We offer individual, couples, relationship, group, and family services. We also offer workshops and consultation.
* We provide personalized body work services individually and in small groups, including yoga, acupuncture, and massage.
* We offer therapy that supports your sense of self, your growth, and your healing through connection and relationship with an awareness of the culture, community, and social consciousness contexts that inform your experience in the world
* We explore and respond to your needs and we support your family and relationship structures.
* We are a resource for gender variant youth and families, gender queer and transgender adults and loved ones, lesbian, gay and queer people, relationships and families.
* We also provide meaningful and informed services to people who have survived trauma, and people with physical and psychiatric disabilities.
* We offer unique intervention and treatment strategies.

Our services are based on the convictions that:

* All people are entitled to self definition and self expression.
* All people are entitled to meaningful participation in the community.
* All people are entitled to the expression and validation of our significant relationships.
* And all people are entitled to services that are informed and responsive to all of who we are.
