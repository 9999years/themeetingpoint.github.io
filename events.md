Let's be honest, folks. February in Boston is terrible...why is it still winter?!

But don't despair! We'd like to invite you to brave the weather and join The Meeting Point community for adventures and (re)discovery in wellness and wholeness!

We will be offering:
* chair massages
* acupuncture
* meditation
* crafts
* yoga
* snacks
* information about Forest Therapy
* blood pressure checks, and more!!

We look forward to seeing you for this radical approach to winter survival.
