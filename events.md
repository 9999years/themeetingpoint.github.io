We are all striving, in our own ways, to evolve. Psychotherapy is a powerful resource for change. There are times when our needs are more focused, when what we most need are the tools that will bring us to the next clearing. The Meeting Point offers workshops and trainings adapted to the needs and interests of our multifaceted communities and selves. The Meeting Point is also available to come to your business, workplace, or group, to provide trainings or workshops tailored to your needs.
