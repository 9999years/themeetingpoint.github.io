## Upcoming Events

### Radical Wellness Fair 
Sunday, February 9, 2020<br>
1pm - 4pm<br>
The Meeting Point<br>
3464 Washington Street<br>
Jamaica Plain, MA 02130

WHY ISN'T IT SPRING YET!?!? Please join The Meeting Point in battling those winter blahs with community, connection, and self care.
February in Boston is kinda the worst! It's windy and icy and it gets dark in the middle of the day. 
But don't despair! We'd like to invite you to brave the weather and join The Meeting Point community for adventures and (re)discovery in wellness and wholeness!

We will be offering:

* chair massages
* acupuncture
* meditation
* crafts
* yoga
* snacks
* art therapy
* information about Forest Therapy
* Zumba
* Rapid HIV Testing
* Prantic (Energy) Healing

* We will be collecting donations for Puerto Rico Disaster Relief

We look forward to seeing you for this radical approach to winter survival.

This event is free and open to the public. Please RSVP with a free ticket, which gives us an idea of how many folks to expect for the fair. Also note, some of the services are first-come, first-serve and require on-site sign-up (e.g. chair massages) so consider coming early and put your names down, then explore the drop-in activities while you wait! Otherwise, join us whenever the mood strikesâ€”we're here for you!
____________

Transportation and Accessibility: The Meeting Point is close to various bus stops (e.g. 42) and the Green Street MBTA subway station (Orange Line). Our space has gender neutral, single-stall restrooms and is wheelchair accessible on the first floor while the 2nd floor has a chairlift for access. There is free on-street parking as well (please do not park in the Meeting Point parking lot). 

* Disclaimer: There will be no yoga puppies. That picture was just to get your attention. But the likelihood of puns is very high!

Co-sponsored by: Imani Massage, 4 Corners Yoga + Wellness, and The Lesbians Of Color Symposium (LOCS) Collective
