The Meeting Point runs both short-term and long-term groups for members of our community. Groups are particularly powerful forms of therapy because individuals are presented with an opportunity to share their strengths and struggles in a confidential setting that is designed to reinforce the value of relationships through both professional and peer.

### Men's Circle - Spring 2021
This group is for men interested in creating a more positive and healthier version of masculinity. It’s for men struggling with the old narratives of what it means to be a man; men who feel isolated and want to be more connected.

Together we can reauthor masculinity so that it serves us all. We can shift limiting stories that tell us we always have to be in control, suppress most of our feelings, and that we can’t speak of our challenges publicly.

Circles are a place to practice being open about our struggles, our strengths, and visions for a better way. We will learn from each other how to tame our inner critic and the shame that prevents us from relating authentically to life. By coming together intentionally with other men we can build greater compassion, strength, and freedom. Through this process we improve our relationships and show up with greater confidence in the world.

**WHAT WE WILL DO**

Circles consist of various practices design to facilitate open dialogue and exploration. These include storytelling, reflection and meditation practice, communication skills, and practice taking care of each other. The circle is participatory. We journey together. As facilitator, attune to each
group’s needs, focusing on the issues most pertinent to the participants. I guide us in creating a secure yet challenging space for healing and growth. I place a strong emphasis on embodiment, and the cultivation compassion and awareness. I also provide suggestions for home-practice and offer resources to integrate the work we do in the group (ex. readings, videos, podcasts.)

This is an ideal group for women who are interested in developing skills or strengthening existing skills to manage anxiety, depression, relationships, and their professional identity.

Groups are particularly powerful forms of therapy because individuals are presented with an opportunity to share their strengths and struggles in a confidential setting that is designed to reinforce the value of relationships through both professional and peer. **If you are interested in participating, please contact Luz Lopez at 617.833-9353 or luzlopez@bu.edu or Dawn Martinez at dawnbelkin@gmail.com.
