The Meeting Point runs both short-term and long-term groups for members of our community. Groups are particularly powerful forms of therapy because individuals are presented with an opportunity to share their strengths and struggles in a confidential setting that is designed to reinforce the value of relationships through both professional and peer.

### Men's Circle - Winter 2021
This group is for men interested in creating a positive and healthy version of masculinity. It is for men struggling with old narratives of what it means to be a man. It is for guys who might feel isolated and who want to feel connected to other men and people in their lives. It is for guys interested in changing the stories we’ve all inherited about what it means to be a man; to reauthor our masculinity.

Only together can we shift out of the limiting stories that tell us we always have to be strong and in control, that we must suppress our feelings and be stoic, that we can’t speak of our challenges publicly.

In circle, we can practice being open and honest about our struggles and our strengths, while learning from each other. We can discover ways to tame the inner critic and shame demon that keep us from relating authentically. By coming together intentionally with other men, we can find greater compassion, strength, and freedom. Through this we can improve our relationships and show up in the world with greater confidence.

**WHAT WE WILL DO**

This circle is a mix of storytelling, developing new practices and frameworks, reflection, and practice in taking care of each other. The circle is participatory; we build it together. As facilitator I aim to be present and attune to the group, focusing on issues which present as most relevant to the participants. I will offer practices that create a safe and productive space, help us to be more embodied, and support compassion and mindfulness. I will also provide suggestions for home-practice and will offer resources (readings, videos, podcasts, etc.) to integrate what we do in the group.

**DETAILS**

Who: Open to anyone who identifies as a man. The circle is capped at 10 men.
When: 8-Week session. 2.4.20-3.25.20. Thursday nights, 7:00-8:30p EST
Where: It is virtual, so wherever you are.
Cost: $200 is the suggested fee. Pay what you can. If you can offer more, please consider doing so to offset a lower-income individual.
Questions: Contact Marlo Pedroso @ pedroso.marlo@gmail.com

This is an ideal group for women who are interested in developing skills or strengthening existing skills to manage anxiety, depression, relationships, and their professional identity.

Groups are particularly powerful forms of therapy because individuals are presented with an opportunity to share their strengths and struggles in a confidential setting that is designed to reinforce the value of relationships through both professional and peer. **If you are interested in participating, please contact Luz Lopez at 617.833-9353 or luzlopez@bu.edu or Dawn Martinez at dawnbelkin@gmail.com.
