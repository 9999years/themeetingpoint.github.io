The Meeting Point runs both short-term and long-term groups for members of our community. Groups are particularly powerful forms of therapy because individuals are presented with an opportunity to share their strengths and struggles in a confidential setting that is designed to reinforce the value of relationships through both professional and peer.

### Women of Color Group
The Women of Color support group is for women of color who are at least 23 years of age and older. This is a bi-weekly group that will meet for 8 weeks. It is limited to 10 women. This group is inclusive of women who are LGBTQ, as well as women who are heterosexual. This is an ideal group for women who are interested in developing skills or strengthening existing skills to manage anxiety, depression, relationships, and their professional identity.

Groups are particularly powerful forms of therapy because individuals are presented with an opportunity to share their strengths and struggles in a confidential setting that is designed to reinforce the value of relationships through both professional and peer. **If you are interested in participating, please contact Luz Lopez at 617.833-9353 or luzlopez@bu.edu or Dawn Martinez at dawnbelkin@gmail.com. Space is limited for this group (no more than 10).**

A note on cost for the group: The fee for the group is based on your income, but the minimum fee is 25.00 per group session. If you would like to pay for the full series up front ($175.00), you save 25.00.

These are some nice groups that have run in the past. Please get in touch if you'd like to resurrect one of them.

#### All-Gender Process and Support Group
Finding your place and the gender spectrum can be complex, confusing, joyful, overwhelming and spectacular. Building your Self and Home on your spot on the spectrum can offer a kind of deepening of self that is like nothing else. Whether you are questioning, building or remodeling your relationship to gender all are welcome here. Group meets every other Monday from 6:30-8 PM.

#### Open Relationship Group
This support group is for individuals and couples interested in exploring the pros and cons of consensual non-monogamy, and whether an open relationship is right for them. It is open to people of any sexual orientation or gender identity as long as they are 18 years of age or older.
