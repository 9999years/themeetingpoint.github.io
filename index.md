We are a collaboration of independent providers who know that oppression is pathology and that social justice heals.

We provide mental health and body work services, we feature local artists and host community events, and we collaborate with community groups and other grassroots organizations. We serve all people, and we specialize in communities of people whose needs have been unrecognized and under-served in medical settings. This includes people of color, those with physical and psychiatric disabilities, and queer and trans people of all genders and identities. We serve all relationship and family structures, and we recognize that coming fully into our Selves happens through our connection to each other.

Our providers offer a range of services and take many kinds of insurance. Some services are available in Spanish. For services or other collaborations please keep in touch via this website, email, or find us on Facebook to learn more.

# Are you a behavioral health provider or body worker looking for office space and community? Please check our "About" section for information on joining The Meeting Point collaborative!
