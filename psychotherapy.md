The Meeting Point is a collective of independent body workers and psychotherapists. Although some of the focuses of the collective include working with GLBT individuals, disability, and trauma, each of our psychotherapists has their own interests and specializations. We invite you to visit their individual pages to learn more about their background, availability, and what insurance they take, so that you may reach out directly to anyone who seems like they might be a good fit.

If you are interested in being seen for psychotherapy at The Meeting Point but do not know exactly what you are looking for in a provider, please call our main referral line at : 877-207-8479. There, you can leave a message with your contact information, availability, and insurance, and we will try to match you up with a provider who fits your needs.
