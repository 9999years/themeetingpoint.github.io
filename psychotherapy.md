The Meeting Point is a collective of independent body workers and psychotherapists. Although many Meeting Point therapists specialize in working with LGBTQI individuals, disability, and trauma, each of our psychotherapists have their own interests and areas of expertise. We invite you to **visit their individual pages below** to learn more about their background, availability, and what insurance they take, so that you may reach out directly to anyone who seems like they might be a good fit.

If you are interested in being seen for psychotherapy at The Meeting Point but do not know exactly what you are looking for in a provider, please email **themeetingpointboston@gmail.com** . 
Please include the following information:
* Preferred name and pronouns
* Age
* How you identify
* Any accessibility needs
* Insurance information
* Availability for appointments
* Any specific preferences for therapy
* Contact Information
 
If a Meeting Point provider has availablity and matches your other criteria, you will receive an update from us using the contact information you provided in the message. If you do not receive a response, it is likely because no one currently has availability. Please try leaving a message again in another 1-2 months, or contact providers individually.
